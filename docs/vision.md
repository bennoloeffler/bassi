# Vision: Personal Assistant
This personal assistant helps me to get shit done.
It can use the computer the same as me:
- files
- email
- calendar
- browser/web
- etc.

Those are the Iterations to realize this personal agent:

Iteration 1:
just talk in dialog to an agent that is able to plan/execute/check/re-plan/redo/ and use bash to solve problems and find files in users folders.

Iteration 2:
extend to search in web

Iteration 3:
extend to read emails or save emails in drafts

Iteration 4:
extend to read calendar

Iteration 5:
extend to automatically save conversations in files (save complete context),
and have a metadata descripiton of the content to find it again.

Iteration 6:
have a timer to shedule tasks in intervals or once

Iteration 7:
use a browser

Iteration 8: ✓ COMPLETED
create python scripts and execute them
(Implemented via task_automation_server.py - Claude writes and executes Python code)

Iteration 9:
install missing software (this is already there - use brew in bash...)

Iteration 10:
add database access (read schema and have a german->sql->data->german interface)
