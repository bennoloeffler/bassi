# Vision: Personal Assistant
This personal assistant helps me to get shit done.
It can use the computer the same as me:
- files
- email
- calendar
- browser/web
- etc.

Those are the Iterations to realize this personal agent:

DONE
Iteration 1:
just talk in dialog to an agent that is able to plan/execute/check/re-plan/redo/ and use bash to solve problems and find files in users folders.

DONE
Iteration 2:
extend to search in web

DONE
Iteration 3:
extend to read emails or save emails in drafts

DONE
Iteration 4:
extend to read calendar

DONE
Iteration 5:
extend to automatically save conversations in files (save complete context),
and have a metadata descripiton of the content to find it again.


Iteration 6:
have a timer to shedule tasks in intervals or once

DONE
Iteration 7:
use a browser

DONE
Iteration 8: 
create python scripts and execute them
(Implemented via task_automation_server.py - Claude writes and executes Python code)


Iteration 9:
install missing software (this is already there - use brew in bash...)


DONE
Iteration 10:
add simple database access (create schema and have a german->sql->data->german interface)


Iteration 11:
add database access (read schema and have a german->sql->data->german interface)
