# AGENTS

## Architecture Snapshot
- The CLI (`bassi/main.py`) and web stack (`bassi/core_v3`) both wrap `BassiAgent` / `BassiAgentSession` to stream Claude Agent SDK responses while wiring in MCP servers for bash, web search, task automation, Microsoft 365, and Playwright capabilities (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`).  
- Session-aware storage (`bassi/core_v3/session_workspace.py` + `session_index.py`) persists uploads, scripts, and chat metadata under `chats/`, while the FastAPI web server exposes `/api/upload`, `/api/capabilities`, and WebSocket streaming endpoints.  
- The web client (`bassi/static/app.js`) renders streaming markdown, interactive tool call panels, verbose levels, interrupt handling, and multimodal uploads; CLI mode uses Rich for the console experience.

## Maintainability & Stability Opportunities
1. **Centralize logging configuration** – both `bassi/agent.py` and `bassi/core_v3/web_server_v3.py` call `logging.basicConfig` at import time with conflicting handlers/levels (`bassi/agent.py:34-47`, `bassi/core_v3/web_server_v3.py:44-51`). Move logging setup into a single bootstrap module or guard it behind `if not logging.getLogger().handlers` to avoid clobbering settings when modules are imported in-process or via uvicorn workers.
2. **Increase agent test coverage** – the top-level tests only cover module import and constructor happy paths; the only chat test is skipped (`tests/test_agent.py:1-88`). Add fixtures that stub the Claude SDK (e.g., via dependency injection or adapter interface) so we can unit-test streaming, verbose toggling, and context persistence without real API calls.
3. **Stream uploads directly to disk** – `SessionWorkspace.upload_file` reads entire files into `content_chunks` before writing, doubling memory usage for large uploads (`bassi/core_v3/session_workspace.py:120-159`). Replace the chunk list with direct streaming writes while hashing, or spool to a temporary file to keep memory bounded at `CHUNK_SIZE`.
4. **Make the thinking-mode toggle functional** – the UI toggle only hides/shows existing `<thinking>` blocks (localStorage + CSS) and never informs the backend to switch models (`bassi/static/app.js:162-225`). Wire a WebSocket `config_change` event plus a server-side option that accepts `:thinking` models and propagates `max_thinking_tokens` so the control actually affects inference.
5. **Expose safer permission modes & hooks** – everything currently runs in `bypassPermissions` with no `hooks` or `can_use_tool` callbacks, even though the docs flag these SDK features as unimplemented opportunities (`docs/features_concepts/permissions.md:9-75`, `docs/agent_sdk_usage_review.md:206-307`). Add an environment-configurable permission mode plus hook-based filters (e.g., to block destructive bash commands or gate MS365 actions) to improve safety and traceability.
6. **Document & enforce session workspace contract** – the spec still lists unimplemented tasks such as listing existing session files or persisting session IDs in localStorage (`docs/features_concepts/session_workspace_tasks.md:157-199`), and the frontend never calls `/api/sessions/{id}/files`. Either finish the UI for browsing prior uploads or update the docs to reflect the current simpler staging behavior to avoid team confusion.

## Documented Features Still Outstanding
| Feature | Source | Gap Observed | Suggested Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tool schema/description fetching | `docs/TODO_TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS.md:1-150` | Help modal still shows placeholders because the backend never queries MCP `tools/list` and no `/api/tool-schemas` endpoint exists. | Implement `mcp_tool_schemas.fetch()` + `/api/tool-schemas`, cache schemas, and hydrate the modal with real descriptions/examples. |
| Thinking mode toggle | `docs/features_concepts/thinking_mode_spec.md:1-120` | UI toggle only flips CSS; no backend config_change message, no support for `claude-sonnet-4-5:thinking`, so the model never emits `<thinking>` blocks on demand. | Add WebSocket message (`type: "config_change", thinking_mode: bool`), plumb through `BassiAgentSession` to swap models and emit thinking events rendered per spec. |
| SDK hooks & permission callbacks | `docs/agent_sdk_usage_review.md:206-307` | Hooks (`PreToolUse`) and `can_use_tool` callbacks remain unimplemented despite being highlighted as high-value safeguards. | Introduce hook matchers for bash/MS365 to enforce allow/deny policies and surface telemetry, and expose toggleable policies via config. |
| Hot reload quality-of-life | `docs/HOT_RELOAD_V3.md:317-375` | Docs note missing browser auto-refresh, module-level HMR, and config reload; today developers still need manual F5 and manual restarts for `.env` changes. | Add SSE-based static watcher for instant refresh, consider Vite/HMR for frontend, and watch `.env`/`.mcp.json` to trigger graceful reloads. |
| Session workspace UI parity | `docs/features_concepts/session_workspace_tasks.md:157-199` | Spec calls for a collapsible file area with persisted session IDs and a `/api/sessions/{id}/files` view, but frontend only stages current uploads and discards them after sending. | Implement local session persistence plus a file browser backed by the existing `SessionWorkspace.list_files()` endpoint so users can re-use previous uploads. |
| Native Python MS Graph MCP server | `docs/features_concepts/ms_graph_server.md:3-75` | Planning doc targets a first-party `create_ms_graph_mcp_server()` but repo still depends on the external Softeria server via `.mcp.json`. | Decide whether to continue relying on the external server or build the in-repo server; update docs either way to avoid dual roadmaps. |

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Prioritize infrastructure fixes (logging, upload streaming, permission hooks) so both CLI and web paths share the same observability and safety guarantees.
2. Schedule the feature work that still lives only in specs (tool schemas, thinking mode, session file browser) and update docs as soon as milestones land to prevent drift.
3. Expand automated tests around `BassiAgentSession`, file uploads, and WebSocket config changes by mocking the Claude SDK—this will make future refactors much safer.
